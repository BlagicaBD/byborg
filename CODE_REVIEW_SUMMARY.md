# Code Review Summary

## General Feedback/Changes
- Use consistent naming conventions, such as camelCase 
- Improve formatting for better readability and maintainability
- Perform a spell check for all elements and methods (e.g., surprice should be corrected to surprise)

## Web elements 
- Group related elements logically to improve organization and readability
- Ensure the naming of elements is consistent and descriptive ( Btn or Button uniformly for all button-related elements)
- Avoid including action verbs (e.g., get, check) in the element names, the focus should be on describing the element itself

## Methods 
- Define utility methods such as waitAndClick and assertElementPresent to ensure cleaner code and better maintainability
- In the utility methods add console.log and include error-catching mechanisms to handle exceptions and for better debugging 
- Introduce a TIMEOUTS constant to standardize and manage wait times across the codebase
- typeInSearch - rename typeInSearch to performSearch to better describe its functionality
- matchName - rename it to verifySearchResults to describe the function. The const 'ele' should be renamed to 'result' to be more descriptive
 -clickOnSearchResult - the method is failing in the tests, the locator is not found, replace it with another locator or press 'Enter'. Rename it to pressEnterToShowAllResults to accurately reflect its purpose of clicking on the "Show All Results" option.
- countAndValidatePerformerNameElements - rename the method to validatePerformerNames for conciseness. Update the method to include correct assertions and implement cleaner, more efficient code.
- navigateToExpectedUrlAndCheckLiveStatus - group the method with checkLiveStream into a single method named handleLiveStatus to consolidate functionality and improve maintainability
- Remove the constant elementCount as it is never used
- signInBtn - remove the unnecessary comma after I.waitForVisible, rename the method to clickOnJoinNowButton to be more descriptive
- addToFav - rename the method to clickAndAddToFavorite to be more descriptive
- getStartedSessionBtn - rename the method to startPrivateSession to make the method name reflective of its functionality
- clickAndCheckSurpriseElements, chooseCategory, validateCategoryFilter - rename the methods to reflect the functionality  
- verifyHomePage - add isGuestUser as parameter to improve flexibility and maintainability
- validateCategoryFilter - remove the comment and ensure the const name is descriptive enough to stand alone. Rename the method to be more descriptive
